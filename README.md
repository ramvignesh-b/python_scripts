# python_scripts
A repository of simplistic yet useful python scripts, I create.

## Contents:
1. ### Amazon_Scrape.py
    A script that scrapes the price_block of the product, monitors and sends a mail to the recipient once it falls below the target price.
    Libraries Used: SMTP Lib and Beautiful Soup. 
    >(Works best when uploaded to a cloud server. I used AWS Lambda)
    
2. ### Checklist.py
    A simple script that uploads file to a file host without any redundancy of re-uploading the same file once again.

3. ### file_transfer.py
    A simple script that automatically sorts the files present in a drive according to their type.
